Welcome.
This file will explain what the folders are supposed to be for, what are You to keep in the, in what form, and some general data.
- pAbout - this folder is to describe all possible information about project. Starting with description, thru economics and prognosis, ending on design data (etc.).
- pImport - Folder for imported assets, referenced projects etc. Most preferably, all should be added via symlinks, as it drastically saves space.
- main - Actual project files. Whatever Your heart desires for it to be - add it here.

Also there are a few files/folders, You shouldn't tamper with, unless You understand the consequences (or are curious).
- .git - Folder with git project manager files
- .gitignore - FIle for files/folders to be ignored, for git version control
- .gitmodules - Modules added within this template plus whatever You added via git to a specific project, made with this template
- LICENCE - File containing some law stuff. Not interesting.
- .hash - File with specific string, to enable zaWarudo's management possible. When creating a project, delete it from copied template, or You will encounter some problems.
- templateReadme.md - This file. It's a readme.
- .obsidian - Folder for obsidian program. Shouldn't be directly tampered with, unless for personalisation.


Inside pAbout:
- Scenario - idk
- aboutProject - general data about project
- startup - what software/hardware do You need, to run the project properly

If You don't get it, look inside, for more information.
